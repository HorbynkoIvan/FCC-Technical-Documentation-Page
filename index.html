            <p>Before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, sugarcane (from which sugar is
                made) was harvested on the shores of the Bay of Bengal; it spread to the
                surrounding territories of Malaysia, Indonesia, Indochina, and southern
                China. The Arabic people introduced "sugar" (at that point a
                sticky paste, semi-crystallized and believed to have medicinal value) to
                the Western world by bringing both the reed and knowledge for its
                cultivation to

                and then Spain in the eighth and ninth
                centuries. Later, Venice—importing finished sugar from
                Alexandria—succeeded in establishing a monopoly over this new spice
                by the fifteenth century; at that point, it started buying raw sugar, and
                even sugarcane, and treating it in its own refineries. Venice's
                monopoly, however, was short-lived. In 1498, Portuguese navigator Vasco da
                Gama returned from India bringing the sweet flavoring to Portugal. Lisbon
                started to import and refine raw sugar, and, in the

                   title="View 'sixteenth' definition from Wikipedia">sixteenth</a>
                century, it became the European sugar capital. It was not long before the sweetener
                was available in France, where its primary function continued to be
                medicinal, and during the reign of Louis XIV, sugar could be bought by the
                ounce at the apothecary. By the 1800s, sugar (though still expensive) was
                widely available to both upper and middle classes.

                Sugar is a broad term applied to a large number of carbohydrates present
                in many plants and characterized by a more or less sweet taste. The
                primary sugar, glucose, is a product of
                <a href="http://www.madehow.com/knowledge/Photosynthesis.html"

                and occurs in all green plants. In most plants, the sugars occur as a mixture that cannot
                readily be separated into the components. In the sap of some plants, the
                sugar mixtures are condensed into syrup. Juices of sugarcane
                <i>(Saccharum officinarum)</i> and sugar beet <i>(Beta vulgaris)</i>
                are rich in pure

                is generally much less sweet than cane sugar. These two sugar crops are the main sources of
                commercial sucrose.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sugarcane is a thick, tall, perennial grass that flourishes in
                tropical or subtropical regions. Sugar synthesized in the leaves is used
                as a source of energy for growth or is sent to the stalks for storage. It
                is the sweet sap in the stalks that is the source of sugar as we know it.
                The reed accumulates sugar to about 15 percent of its weight. Sugarcane
                yields about 2,600,000 tons of sugar per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sugar beet is a beetroot variety with the highest sugar content, for
                which it is specifically cultivated. While typically white both inside and
                out, some beet varieties have black or yellow skins. About 3,700,000 tons
                of sugar are manufactured from sugar beet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other sugar crops include sweet sorghum, sugar maple, honey, and corn
                sugar. The types of sugar used today are white sugar (fully refined
                sugar), composed of clear, colorless or crystal fragments; or brown sugar,
                which is less fully refined and contains a greater amount of treacle
                residue, from which it obtains its color.

                    <p>
                        Sugarcane takes about seven months to mature in a tropical area and
                        about 12-22 months in a subtropical area. At this time, fields of
                        sugarcane are tested for sucrose, and the most mature fields are
                        harvested first. In Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, standing cane is fired
                        to burn off the dry leaves. In Louisiana, the six- to ten-feet (1.8-
                        to 3-meter) tall cane stalks are cut down and laid on the ground
                        before burning.

                    3 After the cane arrives at the mill yards, it is mechanically unloaded,
                    and excessive soil and rocks are removed. The cane is cleaned by
                    flooding the carrier with warm water (in the case of sparse rock and
                    trash clutter) or by spreading the cane on agitating conveyors that pass
                    through strong jets of water and combing drums (to remove larger amounts
                    of rocks, trash, and leaves, etc.). At this point, the cane is clean and
                    ready to be milled.

                        water at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79.4 degrees Celsius) and

                <li>
                    4 Two or three heavily grooved crusher rollers break the cane and
                    extract a large part of the juice, or swing-hammer type shredders (1,200
                    RPM) shred the cane without extracting the juice. Revolving knives
                    cutting the stalks into chips are supplementary to the crushers. (In
                    most countries, the shredder precedes the crusher.) A combination of
                    two, or even all three, methods may be used. The pressing process
                    involves crushing the stalks between the heavy and grooved metal rollers
                    to separate the fiber
                    <i>(bagasse)</i>from the juice that contains the sugar.

                <li>
                    5 As the cane is crushed, hot water (or a combination of hot water and
                    recovered impure juice) is sprayed onto the crushed cane
                    counter currently as it leaves each mill for diluting. The extracted
                    juice, called<i>vesou,</i>contains 95 percent or more of the sucrose present. The mass is then
                    diffused, a process that involves finely cutting or shredding the
                    stalks. Next, the sugar is separated from the cut stalks by dissolving
                    it in hot water or hot juice.

                    ) process is designed to remove both soluble
                    and insoluble impurities (such as sand, soil, and ground rock) that
                    have not been removed by preliminary screening. The process employs
                    lime and heat as the clarifying agents. Milk of lime (about one pound
                    per ton of cane) neutralizes the natural acidity of the juice, forming
                    insoluble lime salts. Heating the lime juice to boiling coagulates the
                    albumin and some of the fats, waxes, and gums, and the precipitate
                    formed entraps suspended solids as well as the minute particles.

                        crystals of precipitate and are removed by continuous filtration.

                    7 The muds separate from the clear juice through sedimentation. The
                    non-sugar impurities are removed by continuous filtration. The final
                    clarified juice contains about 85 percent water and has the same
                    composition as the raw extracted juice except for the removed
                    impurities.

                <li>
                    8 To concentrate this clarified juice, about two-thirds of the water is
                    removed through vacuum evaporation. Generally, four vacuum-boiling cells
                    or bodies are arranged in series so that each succeeding body has a
                    higher vacuum (and therefore boils at a lower temperature). The vapors
                    from one body can thus boil the juice in the next one—the steam
                    introduced into the first cell does what is called
                    <i>multiple-effect evaporation.</i>The vapor from the last cell goes to a condenser. The syrup
                    leaves the last body continuously with about 65 percent solids and 35 percent water.
                    <p>
                        The sugar beet sucrose solution, at this point, is also nearly
                        colorless, and it likewise undergoes multiple-effect vacuum
                        evaporation. The syrup is seeded, cooled, and put in a centrifuge
                        machine. The finished beet crystals are washed with water and dried.

                    is the next step in the manufacture of sugar. Crystallization takes place in a single-stage vacuum

                    until saturated with sugar. As soon as the saturation point has been exceeded,
                    small grains of sugar are added to the pan, or "strike." These small grains, called
                    <i>seed,</i>serve as nuclei for the formation of sugar crystals. (Seed grain is
                    formed by adding 56 ounces [1,600 grams] of white sugar into the bowl of
                    a slurry machine and mixing with 3.3 parts of a liquid mixture: 70
                    percent methylated spirit and 30 percent glycerine. The machine runs at
                    200 RPM for 15 hours.) Additional syrup is added to the strike and
                    evaporated so that the original crystals that were formed are allowed to
                    grow in size.
                    <p>
                        The growth of the crystals continues until the pan is full. When
                        sucrose concentration reaches the desired level, the dense mixture of
                        syrup and sugar crystals, called<i>massecuite,</i>
                        is discharged into large containers known as crystallizers.
                        Crystallization continues in the crystallizers as the massecuite is

                    10 Massecuite from the mixers is allowed to flow into centrifugals,
                    where the thick syrup, or molasses, is separated from the raw sugar by
                    centrifugal force.

                    11 The high-speed centrifugal action used to separate the massecuite
                    into raw sugar crystals and molasses is done in revolving machines
                    called centrifugals. A centrifugal machine has a cylindrical basket
                    suspended on a spindle, with perforated sides lined with wire cloth,
                    inside which are metal sheets containing 400 to 600 perforations per
                    square inch. The basket revolves at speeds from 1,000 to 1,800 RPM. The
                    raw sugar is retained in the centrifuge basket because the perforated
                    lining retains the sugar crystals. The mother liquor, or molasses,
                    passes through the lining (due to the centrifugal force exerted). The
                    final molasses<i>(blackstrap molasses)</i>containing sucrose,
                    reducing sugars, organic nonsugars, ash, and water,
                    is sent to large storage tanks.

                        Once the sugar is centrifuged, it is "cut down" and sent
                        to a granulator for drying. In some countries, sugarcane is processed
                        in small factories without the use of centrifuges, and a dark-brown
                        product (noncentrifugal sugar) is produced. Centrifugal sugar is
                        produced in more than 60 countries while noncentrifugal sugar in about
                        twenty countries.

                    12 Damp sugar crystals are dried by being tumbled through heated air in
                    a granulator. The dry sugar crystals are then sorted by size through
                    vibrating screens and placed into storage bins. Sugar is then sent to be
                    packed in the familiar packaging we see in grocery stores, in bulk
                    packaging, or in liquid form for industrial use.

                The bagasse produced after extracting the juice from sugar cane is used as
                fuel to generate steam in factories. Increasingly large amounts of bagasse
                are being made into paper, insulating board, and hardboard, as well as
                furfural, a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of furan and
                tetrahydrofuran.

                The beet tops and extracted slices as well the molasses are used as feed
                for cattle. It has been shown that more feed for cattle and other such
                animals can be produced per acre-year from beets than from any other crop
                widely grown in the United States. The beet strips are also treated
                chemically to facilitate the extraction of commercial pectin.

                The end product derived from sugar refining is blackstrap molasses. It is
                used in cattle feed as well as in the production of industrial alcohol,
                yeast, organic chemicals, and rum.

                Mill sanitation is an important factor in quality control measures.
                Bacteriologists have shown that a small amount of sour bagasse can infect
                the whole stream of warm juice flowing over it. Modern mills have
                self-cleaning troughs with a slope designed in such a way that bagasse
                does not hold up but flows out with the juice stream. Strict measures are
                taken for insect and pest controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because cane spoils relatively quickly, great steps have been taken to
                automate the methods of transportation and get the cane to the mills as
                quickly as possible. Maintaining the high quality of the end-product means
                storing brown and yellow refined sugars (which contain two percent to five
                percent moisture) in a cool and relatively moist atmosphere, so that they
                continue to retain their moisture and do not become hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most granulated sugars comply with standards established by the National
                Food Processors Association and the pharmaceutical industry (U.S.
                Pharmacopeia, National Formulary).
